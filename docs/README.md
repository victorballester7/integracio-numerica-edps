# Numerical integration of partial differential equations

This repository contains the code of two types of code:

- Exercises done in `Octave`
- The project of the course

The project consists in integrating the heat equation in a 2D plate with two different method, both using finite difference. The first one is a explicit method, the second one is the implicit method of Crank-Nicolson.

Here are the results, when heating up the plate from the center with a source of constant heat:
